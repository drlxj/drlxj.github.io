I am a first-year PhD candidate at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) and [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), supervised by Prof. [Antti Oulasvirta](https://users.aalto.fi/~oulasvir/) and Prof. [MingFei Sun](https://mingfeisun.github.io/) under the [ELLIS program](https://ellis.eu/). 

I earned my Master's degree in Robotics, Systems, and Control from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I had the privilege of being supervised by Prof. [Luc Van Gool](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TwMib_QAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Chrisitan Holz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OfXP9jMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [RWTH Aachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1) through the [FTBA](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/studium/vor-dem-studium/zugangsvoraussetzungen/besonderheiten-internationale-studienint/~cvvm/fast-track-bachelor-admission-ftba/?lidx=1) program.

My research experience includes internships with the [Disney Research Studio](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/) led by [Robert Sumner](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/people/bob-sumner/), and at [Frauenhofer IPT](https://www.ipt.fraunhofer.de/en.html).
